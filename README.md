RAPlanner

General idea:
App for planning what to play/dev next(separate lists), and what they have already played. Inspired by MAL.
Shows the game's name, console, show a progression of the game, and a link to the game's page.

Additional ideas to be added:
- Display image using API?
- Progress of the game using APIKEY?
- Style the application
- When the user marks the game completed/tried, it asks the user whether to delete the game from the database
- doubleclicking on the game opens a new window that shows detailed info for the game
